# AgenticAI-DeckMCP

**AgenticAI-DeckMCP** is a powerful Agentic AI tool with integrated **Deck MCP Server** support that streamlines Kong Gateway management. It can take an API specification file, convert it into Deck format, and seamlessly sync routes, services, and upstreamsâ€”all without the need for manual curl commands. With **natural language prompts** and integration with Cursor, it makes configuring and managing Kong smoother, faster, and more intuitive than ever.

## Features

- Convert **spec files** directly into **Deck** configurations and Run **Deck commands** via MCP server
- Seamlessly sync **routes**, **services**, and **upstreams**
- Apply **plugins** with a single natural language prompt
- Compatible with **Kong 3.x**
- Works with **Cursor** or any MCP-compatible client

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 18** (supports native `fetch`)
- **npm**
- **Deck CLI** installed globally
- **Kong Admin API** running (default: `http://localhost:8001`)

---

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AgenticAI-DeckMCP.git
cd AgenticAI-DeckMCP
```
2.Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3.Start the MCP server:
```bash
node index.js
```
The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp

### Configure Cursor
 1.Open Cursor and create a file in `.cursor\mcp.json`.
 
 2.Add a new server with the following configuration:
 ```bash
 {
  "mcpServers": {
    "deck_mcp_server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Save and start a Cursor session with this MCP server.

### Verify Tools

Once the MCP server is running in Cursor:

  1.Open a new session

  2.Check the available tools (deck_dump, deck_sync, deck_diff, deck_openapi_convert, deck_add_basic_auth, deck_add_key_auth).

### Notes 

1.Ensure Deck CLI is compatible with your Kong version (3.x or above)

2.When adding plugins, either service_name or route_name must be provided

3.For Cursor, always start the MCP server first before launching a session
